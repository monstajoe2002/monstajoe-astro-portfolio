		Iâ€™m a Computer Science at the GIUAS (German International University of
		Applied Sciences) in my fifth semester. Iâ€™m currently majoring in
		Software Engineering with a minor in Data Science. When I was very
		young, like way back when, I had my first PC computer with Windows XP.
		You could this when my fascination with technology and computer began.
		It is no surprise that I would enroll in Computer Science over a decade
		later. My dream is to move to the USA to work for Microsoft.
