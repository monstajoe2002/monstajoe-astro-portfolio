     <p class="flex text-xl text-center p-10 text-blue-secondary mx-0">
		Iâ€™m currently majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Data
		Science. When I was very young, like way back when, I had my first PC
		computer with Windows XP. You could this when my fascination with
		technology and computers began. It is no surprise that I would enroll in
		Computer Science over a decade later. My dream is to move to the USA to
		work for Microsoft.
